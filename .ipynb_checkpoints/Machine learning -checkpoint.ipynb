    "## What is machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, ML is a techique which uses statistical method, enabling machines to learn from their past data, predicts whats going to come next and improves its self.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, ML is the science of making computers learn and act like humans by feeding data and information without being explicitly programmed.\n",
